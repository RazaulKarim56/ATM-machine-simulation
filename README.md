# 🏧 ATM Machine Simulation in Java

A console-based simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM), developed using Java and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts. This project is designed to replicate basic ATM functionalities and demonstrate practical use of core Java OOP principles.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project aims to simulate a simple ATM system with the following functionalities:
- User authentication via PIN
- Balance inquiry
- Depositing money
- Withdrawing money
- Exiting the session

The program uses **abstraction**, **encapsulation**, **inheritance**, and **polymorphism** to model real-world banking behavior in an object-oriented way.

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

- Apply Java OOP concepts in a real-world simulation
- Provide a menu-driven console interface
- Help beginners understand object-oriented design
- Simulate secure banking operations (PIN-based access)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Java (Java SE 8+)
- **IDE Recommended:** IntelliJ IDEA / Eclipse / NetBeans / BlueJ
- **Dependencies:** None (Standard Java)

## 🧠 OOP Concepts Used

| Concept       | Application in Project                                          |
|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Encapsulation** | Private data members with controlled access via getters/setters |
| **Inheritance**   | `ATMUser` class inherits from abstract `Account` class         |
| **Polymorphism**  | Method overriding for custom behaviors                         |
| **Abstraction**   | Abstract class `Account` hides implementation details          |

## 🧪 Features Implemented

- 🔐 **Login System**: PIN-based authentication
- 💰 **Balance Inquiry**
- 💸 **Deposit Money**
- 💵 **Withdraw Money**
- 🚪 **Exit Function**

> PIN for test account: `1234`  
> Default balance: `$1000.00`

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download the project files.
2. Open `ATMSystem.java` in your Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the file.
4. Enter the PIN (`1234`) to access your account.
5. Use the menu to perform ATM operations.
