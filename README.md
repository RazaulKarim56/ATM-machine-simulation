ATM Machine Simulation in Java 🏧
This project is a console-based ATM simulation system developed in Java using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.

🎯 Project Purpose
Simulate basic ATM functionalities such as:

User login via PIN
Balance inquiry
Deposit
Withdrawal
Exit
🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: Java (Core Java, Java SE)
Tools: Any IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse)
🧠 OOP Concepts Applied
Encapsulation – Private account data with public getters/setters
Inheritance – ATMUser inherits from Account class
Polymorphism – Overriding and overloading methods
Abstraction – Abstract class Account defines general behavior
📋 How to Run
Open the project in a Java IDE
Compile and run ATMSystem.java
Use default PIN: 1234 to log in
✅ Features Implemented
User authentication
Balance check
Deposit & withdrawal
Menu-driven interface
